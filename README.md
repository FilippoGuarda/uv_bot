# Uv Robot


### Objectives

This project aims to use a turtlebot3 "burger" as a base for an Uv lamp. This lamp has to be moved in a closed environment in order to ensure optimal radiation of uv light, disinfecting said environment. 
The turtlebot must map and navigate said environment, calculating an optimal path to reach its objectives.
